# Spotify Analysis 2019

In this Data Science project, we analyze the most popular songs on the music streaming platform Spotify and try to find out whether there are any particular features that differentiate the top songs from the less popular ones. To accomplish this, we are using a dataset that was uploaded to Kaggle.com and contains 232.000 songs of 26 genres â€“ or about 160.000 unique songs, since some tracks are assigned to multiple genres. Additionally, we use iTunes data from Kworb.net to investigate if high worldwide popularity on Spotify leads to higher popularity in terms of worldwide digital purchases of songs on iTunes. 

Main questions:
- Are there features that have an impact on the worldwide popularity of a song?
- Is there a difference between the features that make a song popular in different countries?
  - Comparison of five countries: Austria, Australia, Brazil, Japan, United States
- Does worldwide popularity on Spotify correlate with worldwide sales on iTunes?
